Personal webpage for Bihan Samarasinghe — Datacenter Engineer (Tailwind CDN quick-start)

Files:
- `index.html` — single-page personal site. Open directly in a browser.

How to use:
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or `xdg-open` on Linux).
2. Edit the file to update name, email, images, and project details.

Notes:
- This template uses the Tailwind CDN for quick iteration and doesn't require a build step.
- For production, consider a local Tailwind build to purge unused CSS and add asset optimization.

Suggested next steps I can do for you:
- Add a mobile-friendly nav with accessible toggling.
- Replace placeholder images with your photo and update contact email.
- Scaffold a small repo with Tailwind/PostCSS, or convert to a React/Vite app for components and routing.
